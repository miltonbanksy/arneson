  <h2>CHARACTER CREATION</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Write down a Name, be evocative and be creative. Namescan implyTraits.</li>
    <li>Write down a few words or phrases, called Traits, about your character, the referee will approve or suggest changes. Traits should be specific and not overly general.</li>
    <li>Write down any Gear you might be carrying. Gear should be specific items that may help with the quest.</li>
    <li>Your character has 4 Hit Points. The referee may award more if your Traits suggest it.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <h2>TESTS</h2>
  <p>When resolutions are not clear, the referee will call for a test. Players will roll 2d6:</p>
  <p>If one of your Traits can help, roll 3d6, but keep only the highest two dice rolled. If a trait could hinder you, roll 3d6 but keep only the two lowest rolled dice.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>High roll = successful, good results.</li>
    <li>Middling roll = does not change the situation, or negotiated /mixed results (fleeting success, success with a downside, failure with an upside).</li>
    <li>Low roll = unsuccessful, bad result</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>OPPOSED & COMBAT</h2>
  <p>Both combatants roll 2d6 (or 3d6, keep in mind Traits). The side with the high result is successful. If a tie, we negotiate. The difference in rolls is the damage or effectiveness of the success.</p>
  
  <h2>GEAR</h2>
  <p>Some Gear provides a +1 to rolls. Some Gear causes more damage or may have effects outside of hit points. Armor grants extra hit points. The referee has the final say on this type of ruling.</p>
  
  <h2>ADVANCEMENT</h2>
  <p>The referee will level the characters as they progress through the adventures. Upon leveling, the player will raise their character’s HP by 2 or add a Trait. New Traits should be a reflection of the narrative of the game.</p>
