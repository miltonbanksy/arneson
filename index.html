  <h2>CHARACTER CREATION</h2>
  1. Write down a Name, be evocative and be creative. Namescan implyTraits. 
  <br>2. Write down a few words or phrases, called Traits, about your character, the referee will approve or suggest changes. Traits should be specific and not overly general.
  <br>3.Write down any Gear you might be carrying. Gear should be specific items that may help with the quest.
  <br>4. Your character has 4 Hit Points. The referee may award more if your Traits suggest it. 
  
  <h2>TESTS</h2>
  When resolutions are not clear, the referee will call for a test. Players will roll 2d6:
  <p>High roll = successful, good results.</p>
  <p>Middling roll = does not change the situation, or negotiated /mixed results (fleeting success, success with a downside, failure with an upside).</p>
  <p>Low roll = unsuccessful, bad result</p>
  <p>If one of your Traits can help, roll 3d6, but keep only the highest two dice rolled. If a trait could hinder you, roll 3d6 but keep only the two lowest rolled dice.</p>
